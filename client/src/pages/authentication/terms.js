          and dispute resolution provisions.<br></br>
          13. Warranty Disclaimers. THE SERVICES, OUR CONTENT, AND YOUR DATA (AS
          YOUR DATA IS PRESENTED ON THE SERVICES) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT
          WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY
          DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY
          WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
          <br></br>
          14. Indemnity. You will indemnify and hold harmless Engageall and its

          BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL
          DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS,
          LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE
          INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF
          SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
          THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, OUR
          CONTENT, OR YOUR DATA, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT
          (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY,
          AND WHETHER OR NOT ENGAGEALL OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF
          THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH
          HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME
          JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
          FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY
          NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br></br>
          2. IN NO EVENT WILL ENGAGEALL’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN
          CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
          SERVICES, OUR CONTENT, OR YOUR DATA EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID
          OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO ENGAGEALL FOR USE OF THE SERVICES, OUR
          CONTENT, OR YOUR DATA, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT
          HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO ENGAGEALL, AS APPLICABLE.<br></br>
          3. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
          FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN ENGAGEALL AND
          YOU.<br></br>
          16. Governing Law. These Terms and any action related thereto will be
          governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, without regard to its
          conflict of laws provisions.<br></br>
          17. General Terms.<br></br>
          1. Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive
          understanding and agreement between Engageall and you regarding the
          Services, Our Content and Your Data, and these Terms supersede and
          replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements
          between Engageall and you regarding the Services, Our Content, and
          Your Data. If we execute an Order Form with you, the terms of the
          Order Form will take precedence over any terms of the Terms that
          conflict with the terms of the Order Form. If any provision of these
          Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of
          competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
          extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain
          in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms,
          by operation of law or otherwise, without Engageall’s prior written
          consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without
          such consent, will be null. Engageall may freely assign or transfer
          these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms
          will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors
          and permitted assigns.<br></br>
          2. Arbitration. ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR
          RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT,
          INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE
          SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THESE TERMS TO ARBITRATE, SHALL BE
          DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA BEFORE
          ARBITRATOR(S). THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS PURSUANT
          TO ITS COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES THEN IN EFFECT
          AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES IN THOSE RULES OR
          PURSUANT TO JAMS’ STREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES.
          JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION.
          THIS CLAUSE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE PARTIES FROM SEEKING PROVISIONAL
          REMEDIES IN AID OF ARBITRATION FROM A COURT OF APPROPRIATE
          JURISDICTION.<br></br>
          3. Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Engageall
          under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these
          Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the
          Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be
          deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.<br></br>
          4. Waiver of Rights. Engageall’s failure to enforce any right or
          provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right
          or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be
          effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
          representative of Engageall. Except as expressly set forth in these
          Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these
          Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these
          Terms or otherwise.<br></br>
          Contact Information. <br></br> If you have any questions about these Terms or
          the Services, please contact Engageall at contact@engageall.co.
